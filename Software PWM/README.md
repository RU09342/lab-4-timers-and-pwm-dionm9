# Software PWM
This program, like many others, start with initilizing the device, the LED output, and the button inputs. The timer was then set up to run at 250 Hz by setting the internal divier to 8, setting to up mode, and having the timer run on the SMCLK. CCR0 interupts were enables along with CCR1 interupts. The program worked by turning the LED off when CCR1 interupted, and turning on when CCR0 interupted. To counter the LED flashing for 1 clock cycle when CCR0 and CCR1 were the same, an if statement was put in place on the CCR0 interupt to have a true 0% state.
